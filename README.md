# BrainDump iOS App: Notetaking App for ADHD

## What is BrainDump?
BrainDump is an iOS note app for a writing technique called "brain dump".
This technique is recommended for people with ADHD to "dump" every thoughts that are racing in their head to get empty it out and get more objective view of their thoughts.
For now, it only has a timer, notification blocker, and a UITextField, which I will develop further down the road.

## Future Plans
- Store notes
- After the braindump, user can highlight some parts of the dump / write a summary of the dump.
- Maybe integrate with Reminders? I use that a lot. 

## Suggestions?
